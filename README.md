# Welcome to my Drum Machine google chrome extension project !

## Setting up the extension.

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `chrome://extensions`
When it is done, you can go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and drop the entire build folder.

It's all ! You can test the extension !
